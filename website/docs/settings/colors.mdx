<Version version="1.0.0" source="glsass-settings/_settings.colors.scss" />

The palette (or color scheme) follow other framework logic, like `primary` and
`secondary` colors, states (`success`, `danger`...) and variants (`100` to
`900`).

Each color is definied by two parameters : name and variant. Other keywords are
use to simplify the palette's use.

```scss
base  == 500 variant
light == 200 variant
dark  == 700 variant
```

Extra variant are also created like the `light` color which is rely to the
`gray - 100` by default, or `text` with `gray - 900`.

The [cv() function](tools/cv.mdx) offer a simpler way to access to a specific
color instead of use the variable name like `$g-color-primary` or
`$g-color-gray-800`.

## Palette

All default colors are visible below ðŸ‘‡<br/>The text colors are generated to
respect the better contrast with the
[color-contrast() function](tools/color.mdx#color-contrast).
