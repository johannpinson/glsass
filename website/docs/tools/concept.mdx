import Version from '@site/src/components/Version/'

<Version source="glsass-tools/_tools.global.scss" />

The `tools` folder contains Sass helpers, as mixins and functions, used inside
the whole codebase. Of course, all this code can be used standalone, or for
writing your own components.

## Global

```scss
@use "@glsass/tools/tools.global" as *;
```

This special file doesn't contain a function or mixin! It used to forward the
most common one:

- [cv()](./cv.mdx)
- [iv()](./iv.mdx)
- [mq() and mq-max()](./mq.mdx)
- [vr()](./spacing.mdx#vr)

By forwarding them, when the file is import with the `@use` rule, the namespace
must be set at \*. It will load the module without a namespace, and avoid to
call some functions like form example.

## Others tools

### Builder

The file contains special functions/mixins used to check and facilitate the
compilation of the framework.

As an exemple, the mixin `check-classname` is used to verify that the string
passed as variable to a module doesn't start by a point.

### Form

This file contains a special mixin used to create dynamically the states classes
for several components.

### Generators

This other file contains the mixin used by the
[utilities classes](utilities/api.mdx).
