and tools.

Moreover, it completely change the logic behind the color _deduction_ for better
contrast.

## What's new?

### New feature

The main change is about colors function, more precisely the contrast ratio
calculation to select a color to use.

The old function `yiq-contrast` works well in many cases, but it didn't respect
the WCAG standard about minimal contrast between background and foreground
colors.

The `contrast` module add functions following the WCAG requirements to respect
at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Theses functions are all documentated in the a
[dedicated page](/docs/tools/contrast).

All internal functions are now working this module to determine the best color
to use.

The framework also delivers 5 additionnal components, two about forms, a new
utility (elevation) and create two NPM packages for customizing layers
requirements.

**Summary:**

- new `contrast` tool (5 functions) ([docs](/docs/tools/contrast))
- new `switch` components - add an further display for `input[type=checkbox]`
  ([docs](/docs/components/form#switch))
- new `range` component - allow to personalize `input[type=range]`
  ([docs](/docs/components/form#range))
- new `breadcrumb` component ([docs](/docs/components/breadcrumb))
- new `pagination` component ([docs](/docs/components/pagination))
- new `tooltip` component ([docs](/docs/components/tooltip))
- new `elevation` utility ([docs](/docs/utilities/elevations))
- new `@glsass/basics` package - Generics + Elements layers
  ([npm](http://npmjs.com/package/@glsass/basics))
- new `@glsass/patterns` package - Objects + Components layers
  ([npm](http://npmjs.com/package/@glsass/patterns))

### Breaking change

The variable names from `@glsass/grapgics/graphics.fonts` change to make it more
consistent and logic through the codebase. It also adds variables about each
baseline (used for `line-height`).

### Bug fix

This new version contains the previous fix from the `v1.0.1` to add the
`index.scss` file on the object layer.

## Documentation

Documentation is already updated with the changes listed, and the v1.1.0 now
become the default version.

The first sections add more details about exitCSS (inspiration and concept) and
the [vertical rhythm](/docs/vertical-rhythm).

You can find all versions available [here](/versions).
