Glsass (spell it simply Glass) is a Sass framework working with Sass Modules and
following the exitCSS pattern for extensible and responsive front development.

The framework provides generics/starter rules, a grid system, extensible
components and utilities, with a global project architecture.

Since Glsass is focused on a `SCSS` environment, there is **no** download
archive, no CDN or compiled CSS files.

**It's up to you to build your own Sass project by using only what you need!**
