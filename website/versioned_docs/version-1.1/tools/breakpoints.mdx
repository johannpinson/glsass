## _suffix()_

<Version version="1.0.0" />

The response classes work with a suffix to determine the minimal breaking point
to be actived. The `suffix` function return the name of the breakpoint with the
"@" in front

```scss
breakpoint.suffix($name, $breakpoints: core.$g-grid-breakpoints);

$v: breakpoint.suffix("xs");
// Returns a blank string because it's the smallest breakpoint

$v: breakpoint.suffix("md");
// Returns "\@sm"
```

## _media-up()_

<Version version="1.0.0" />

This mixin includes the content inside a media queries rules with the breakpoint
given. It's mainly used for the utilities generator and the grid layout.

```scss
breakpoint.media-up($name, $breakpoints: core.$g-grid-breakpoints);
```
