<Version version="1.0.0" source="glsass-graphics/" />

**Remimder:** Graphics files contains many variables, similar to settings.

:::info

**Why `Graphics` variables are'nt forwarded from `Settings`?**

Since the files contains variables depending of the others settings and some
functions from tools, it cannot be set with functions that don't exist yet.

You cannot use the function `meta.call()` from the built-in modules of Sass,
because the function is executed at the call, not when the variable are set (it
will result as an error).

:::

```scss
// If every settings were forwaded from the same place, it will result to have
// a variable with a string value equal to `cv(black)`, not the color `#000`
@use "@glsass/settings" with (
  $g-color-black: #111,
  $ui-form-background-color: cv(black), // × wrong, will equal to `cv(black)`
);

// The variables overriding must be done in two times
@use "@glsass/settings" with ($g-color-black: #111);
@use "@glsass/tools/tools.cv" as *;
@use "@glsass/graphics" with(
  $ui-form-background-color: cv(black), // ✓ correct, will equal to `#111`
);

// Alternative setups
@use "@glsass/settings" with ($g-color-black: #111) as *; // avoid namespace
@use "@glsass/graphics" with(
  $ui-form-background-color: $g-color-black, // ✓ aslo correct!
);
```

:::note

Inside the codebase, graphics variable use the `ui` prefix to simplify the
namespace.
