<Version version="1.0.0" source="glsass-settings/_settings.core.scss" />

The core file regroups the main SCSS variables used through all the codebase of
Glsass. All of them are overridable when the file is imported.

You will fin inside settings for fonts, spacers and responsive breakpoints

```scss
// Keep the default settings
@use "@glsass/settings/settings.core";

// Or add your own settings
@use "@glsass/settings/settings.core" with (
  $g-font-size-base: 1.25rem, // intended to be equal to `20px`
  $g-grid-columns: 8, // change the max column number
);
```

Settings files are also forwarded from the index file in the folder to simplify
the overrides.

```scss
@use "@glsass/settings" with (
  // add your overrides here
);
```
