The `generics` folder has the first "real" code, because the previous layers
don't ouput any CSS. It comes with similar concept from reset, normalize and
reboot.

```scss
// GENERIC - Don't change the order for generic modules
@forward "@glsass/generics/generics.reset";
@forward "@glsass/generics/generics.shared";
@forward "@glsass/generics/generics.fonts";

/* Or import all of generics files */

// GENERIC
@forward "@glsass/generics";
```

## CSS resets

The goal is not to tell the history about CSS resets, but Glsass is inspires by
three methods:

- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [Meyer reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css)
- [Bootstrap Reboot](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_reboot.scss)

One of the first tools is `Normalize.css` to homogenize some behaviors **accross
browsers**. Then, with the Meyer reset, it removes default styling from browser
(on top of Normalize). Next, like the Reboot from Bootstrap, we had some
opinionated rules to prepare some elements to work with the rest of the
framework.

### Reset

Combining some rules from Normalize.css and the Meyer's reset, it improve
default renders for some elements.<br/> For example, it removes extra margin and
padding on sime elements and nested lists.

### Shared

There are the first opinionated rules to standardize some elements behavior.
Actually, it's used only to ensure the default `box-sizing` property for all
elements and to declare `margins` in the same direction.

In the future, it can be more similar to Reboot.css logic from Bootstrap, which
"_correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly
more opinionated resets to common HTML elements._".

Some rules available here can be contradictory with those present in the
`elements` folder, but it's "normal". In the next layer, you will find styles
for HTML tags one by one, so it's avoid to create one file by element category.

### Fonts

If you want to use a Google Font, it will import necessary styles before to use
it in next layer (especially in _Elements_ to set the default font of the
stylesheet).
